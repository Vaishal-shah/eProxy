# eProxy
The project provides an environment where students can get/pay points for giving proxies(fake attendance) of other students.
It allows user to create his id and he is gifted initial 1000 points and his timetable is fetched from the database.
The user can then see the classes of the day and decide whether he will go or not.
If he decides not to go, then he can demand for proxy and set the bidding price to anyone who gives his attendance in that particular class.
Or if he decides to go, he can see the list of students who demanded for a proxy and their bid and he can select any number of students for giving their attendance. Once he selects them, the points will be transfered to his account from the account of absentees.

## It is designed by Arundhati Banerjee, Yara Manisha and Vaishal Shah while participating in Microsoft Code.Fun.Do Hackathon 2017.
